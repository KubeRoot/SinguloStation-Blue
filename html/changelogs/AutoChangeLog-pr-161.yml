changes:
  - rscadd: Adds a camera viewing app, SecurEye, available for download on laptops
      and modular consoles to those that have security access.
  - tweak: Camera console UIs (including for SecurEye) now have the search field locked
      on screen, rather than scrolling up with the camera list.
