changes:
  - code_imp: Failsafe is more robust now and the game can actually recover from a
      deleted MC
  - code_imp: Albeit far from perfect, the game will be fairly playable if the Master
      Controller dies. It beats the alternative by a lot if there's no admin online
      to reboot the server.
